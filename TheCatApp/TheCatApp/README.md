#  The Cats App

###-   I have implemented `MVC` design pattern
###-   I have used `swift 5` and `xcode 13.2.1` to develop this app
###-   I have targetted `iphone X` as compatible simulator just to test
###-   There are two views: cat `list view` and `detailed view`
###-   I have implemented category filter and default selected is: `sunglasses`
###-   Images are `cached` so that it loads faster next time
###-   `Indefinite scrolling` is implemented (load data on demand) 
###-   `Unit Test cases` is implemented, data.json file is added in bundle for mock data to be tested
